# `$ whoami`

Hey there! My name's Bytewave, Byte, or Eliot. I make things and break things... ~~mostly break things~~.

I currently hold a B.S. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas. One of these days, I hope to go into infosec... we'll see how that ends up.

Feel free to poke around my projects, be it to contribute to, learn from, or just criticize my questionable practices. I license all my more recent work under MIT, with older projects sometimes falling under MPL 2.0. You can check out the projects I'm most proud of in the pinned repos area below this box.

## `$ cat homepage.md`

Check out [my homepage](https://code.horse). There, you can find my social links and other ways to contact me.

## `$ cat employment.md`

As of August 2021, I am no longer looking for work.
