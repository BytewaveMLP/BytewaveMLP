Hey there! My name's Bytewave, Byte, or Eliot. I make things and break things... ~~mostly break things~~.

I'm currently a university student studying Computer Science. One of these days, I hope to go into infosec... we'll see how that ends up.

Feel free to poke around my projects, be it to contribute to, learn from, or just criticize my questionable practices. I license all my more recent work under MIT, with older projects sometimes falling under MPL 2.0. You can check out the projects I"m most proud of in the pinned repos area below this box.

Check out [my homepage](https://code.horse). There, you can find my social links and other ways to contact me.

## `$ cat employment.md`

If you're a recruiter who's stumbled across my profile, I'm looking for work! If you'd like to contact me, you can find my primary contact email off to the left. I'm proficient in TypeScript and Node.js, and experienced in lots of other languages, including C#, Java, Python, and PHP. As stated previously, I'm also pursuing a career in information security, so cybersecurity internships are also welcome. Thanks for taking the time to visit! ðŸ’š
